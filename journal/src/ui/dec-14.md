# bugs
- [ ] Have to move mouse to update the chart on initial render
- [ ] Chart "no data" label goes outside the chart area if origin of chart / range is different.

## loading anvil

We can save anvil to a string and load it back up. The problem is getting all the contract addresses set properly from that.
We can store all the addresses in the contacts book on inital deploy. Then when we load the app we can map those addresses into the client.

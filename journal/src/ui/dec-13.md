# Axioms

Excalibur is architected to follow the Model-View-Controller architecture. These are the axioms contributors should follow:
- Model handles data. View handles presentation. Controller manages data, view, and user input.
- Model and view do not communication.
- Data flows in one direction from Model -> Controller -> View.

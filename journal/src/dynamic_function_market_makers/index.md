# Dynamic Function Market Makers
Automated Market Makers (AMMs) have been extensively studied in DeFi and usually appear in the form of Constant Function Market Makers (CFMMs).
CFMMs are a special case of a more general class of AMMs called Dynamic Function Market Makers (DFMMs).
The main difference between CFMMs and DFMMs is that CFMMs maintain a constant **invariant** or **bonding function** while DFMMs can allow for parameters of the bonding function to change over time.

## Examples
We will provide two examples of CFMMs and their DFMM counterparts. 
First is the [Geometric Mean Market Maker (GMMM)](./geometric_mean.md) and the second is the [Log Normal Market Maker (LNMM)](./log_normal.md).

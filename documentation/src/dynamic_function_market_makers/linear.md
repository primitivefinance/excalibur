# Linear

These are considered to be the constant sum market makers. 
The trading function is linear in the number of prices. 
These can be thought of as a trading function that is made of of a bunch of straight lines where each of the lines corrosponds to a price of assets(slope of the line) in a set range of liquidity(lenght of the line). 
They can be composed of any number of prices for many or the same asset( $x=y$ or $x\neq y$ ). 
As you increase the number of lines the infinite sum of these approach a smooth continous non-linear function.
$$
\varphi(x,y) = P_1 x + P_2 y

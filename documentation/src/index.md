# Excalibur
Excalibur is a desktop application for performant interface for decentralized finance build with [iced](https://iced.rs/). 
Iced is a cross-platform GUI library for Rust focused on simplicity and type-safety inspired by [Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/architecture/).
The application uses [Arbiter](https://github.com/primitivefinance/arbiter) and the rust ethereum ecosystem to communicate with both mock and live networks.
We have decided to open source the project and enable outside feedback and contributions.
We believe in the power and ethos of open source.

# Excalibur

## A Vision
Excalibur aims to be a be-all-end all desktop application to service modern decentralized finance. 
The changing financial landscape requires new tools for management for everyone.
It begins with a portfolio management application that allows users to manage their assets and strategies.
These strategies are given not just as Ethereum smart contracts, but they are strapped alongside of the ability to simulate them in a sandbox environment, deploy them to a network, monitor their status, feed updates to offline agents, update the onchain system, and more.
